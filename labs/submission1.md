1. **Benefits of signing commits:**
Commit signing adds a cryptographic signature to my Git commits which confirms that the commit was made by me and it prevents others from committing under my name. It also confirms that commit hasn't been altered: change to the commit after signing breaks the signature. Besides, commit signing mitigates MITM attacks.

2. **"Why is commit signing important in DevOps workflows?"**
- commit signing provides verifiable history for compliance reviews.
- team members can verify each other's work.
- reviewers know commits are authentic and by whom exactly they were made.
